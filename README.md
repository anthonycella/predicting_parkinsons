# Predicting Parkinson's

This project is a machine learning algorithm designed to take in an excel spreadsheet containing both scientific measurements to predict on and a Standard Of Truth (SOT) and output a machine learning model that can predict whether or not a patient has parkinson's disease or not based on similar data without the SOT. The SOT details whether or not a patient has parkinson's disease, with the value of 1 corresponding to a positive diagnosis of parkinson's and 0 corresponding to a negative diagnosis.
